        <div class="paragraph">
            Yo! I'm Vincent, an aspring fullstack developer dipping my feet into the world of web development. <br> <br>
            As a child, problem solving became a double edged sword for me. Formed by the hands of my parents (who subjected me
            to years of tutoring programs), I learned about the concept of independent learning. With rarely any
            help with assignments, it became a skill of mine to figure out the issue, no matter how long it took or how
            many tears were shed from frustration. The dopamine hit that came with each successive problem that I solved became
            addictive, developing as I entered high school and now college. <br> <br>
            Coding became, and is now, my grown-up version of the tutoring programs. With countless amounts of hours
            stuck at an issue, and the following line of code that would fix said issue, the fixation I've had towards problem
            solving has never motivated me more than ever before. This motivation has helped me to learn frontend development, and 
            soon to be backend development, and whatever else scratches the itch of my critical thinking.
